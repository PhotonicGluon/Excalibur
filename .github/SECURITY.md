# Reporting Security Issues

Excalibur is, at its heart, a security product. We take any security issues with Excalibur very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported Versions

As much as we would like to continue addressing security issues for previous versions, we do not have the resources to do so. We recommend using the latest stable version of Excalibur in order to ensure you do not miss our security fixes. As a result, only the latest version of Excalibur will receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/PhotonicGluon/Excalibur/security/advisories/new) tab. We will follow up with you as soon as possible.
