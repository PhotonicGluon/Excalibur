## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/PhotonicGluon/Excalibur/tree/v0.2.0) - 2025-10-04

### üîí Security

- Added an account creation key requirement in order to sign up to the server
- Added missing encryption in some routes
- Changed authentication protocol to use a Proof-of-Possession (PoP) in addition to bearer token

### ‚ú® Additions

- Added multi-user support
- Added server-side configuration file to more easily set up and configure server
- Added the Excalibur Progressive Web App (PWA) to some server distributables
- Added an endpoint that renames a file or folder
- Added logging to files (i.e., server logs will now be written to files)
- Added a banner that appears upon running CLI commands

### ‚úèÔ∏è Changes

- Changed the WebSocket format in the authentication protocol to use a more standardized format
- Changed behaviour for invalid path of directory name in the directory creation endpoint
  - It now returns `406 Not Acceptable` instead of `400 Bad Request` if the directory name is invalid
- Changed default host when starting the server to `localhost` (was `0.0.0.0`)
- Changed default port from `8888` to `52419`
- Made the warnings for 'non-standard' flags (e.g., debug mode) nicer

### üîß Fixes

- Fixed a server-side issue where the encryption/decryption of chunked requests would fail on the app with a message saying "footer must be 16 bytes (got 32 bytes)"
- Fixed an issue where an equivalent endpoint was exposed at a path without the `/api` prefix
- Fixed `well-known` endpoint names
