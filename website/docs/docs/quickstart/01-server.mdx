# Server Quickstart

Set up an Excalibur server for clients to connect.

## Obtaining the Server Distributable

<Tabs groupId="server-type">
    <TabItem value="api-only" label="API Only" default>
    TODO: Add API only download link
    </TabItem>
    
    <TabItem value="with-pwa" label="With PWA">
    TODO: Add PWA download link
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installing

We recommend using [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) to install the server. Run

```bash
pipx install [PATH_TO_WHEEL_FILE]
```

Check that the server is installed correctly by running

```bash
excalibur --version
```

You should see the version of the server printed to the console.

## Running

Run the following command in a terminal.

```bash
excalibur start
```

You can check if the server is running by going to [`http://localhost:8888/api/well-known/version`](http://localhost:8888/api/well-known/version). You should see a response like the following:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "commit": null
}
```

:::tip Host and Port

You might want to change the host and port that the server runs on. You can do this by setting specifying the `--host` and `--port` flags when starting the server. For example, to listen on all IPs and port 8080, run

```bash
excalibur start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

:::

Congratulations! You have successfully set up an Excalibur server. Move on to the [Client Quickstart](./02-client/index.mdx) to set up a client to connect to your server.
