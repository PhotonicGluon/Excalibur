## Banner

The banner background is created by me.

## Splash Screen

The splash screen background is a modified version of _a colorful abstract background with wavy lines_ by [CARTIST](https://unsplash.com/@lilzidesigns?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-colorful-abstract-background-with-wavy-lines-3iUE4iEIdJw?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash).

The following modifications were made:

- Image resized from 2160 x 2700 to 2732 x 2732
- Adjusted `Hue` from `0.00` to `80.00` using the `Hue-Chroma` tool in [GIMP 2.10.38](https://www.gimp.org/)
- Adjusted `Brightness` from `0` to `-100` using `Brightness-Contrast` tool
- Added a Gaussian blur of `10.0` using `Gaussian Blur` tool

The light version of the background is the inverted version.
